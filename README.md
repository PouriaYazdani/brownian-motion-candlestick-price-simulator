# ðŸ“ˆ Reflected Geometric Brownian Motion (RGBM) Price Sequence Generator

This simple code simulates intra-candle price movements for an asset based on provided OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices using a **Reflected Geometric Brownian Motion (RGBM)** approach.

The simulation generates a realistic and smoothly interpolated price path that stays within the candle bounds (`phigh` and `plow`) while respecting the opening and closing prices.

## âœ¨ Features

- Simulates realistic intra-minute price movements based on OHLC data.
- Ensures that generated prices never exceed the provided high/low bounds.
- Smoothly interpolates between open and close prices.
- Easy to modify for different use cases like trading bots, backtesting, synthetic data generation, etc.
